# Introduction

Species interactions shape the communities by impacting their evolution. Even if interactions have been wildly used as integral part of ecological studies (*RRR*), it's only more recently that they have been studied as a component of communities evolution. At short timescale, interaction guide communities composition. For instance inducing competitive exclusion or establishment facilitation . But, due to rapid changes into interaction between species over time and space, it is not always straightforward to see the insight of interaction in community evolution (*RRR*). * focus on closely related species, ecological interactions shapes evolutionary trajectories through trait evolution (or the other way around) * Rezende, Jordano and Bascompte (2007) OIKOS * Thompson 2005 GMTC * Weber et al. 2017 : rapid traits evolution leads to changes in species interactions and ecosystem functioning => larger effects on evolution of communities

Interactions, depending on their type (i.e. positive or negative), generate different out-put on communities evolution. These differences are often difficult to distinguish.
* Silvestro et al. 2015, PNASAm : clade competition : phylogenetically distnat but ecologicaly close ; competition drives to traits displacement and extinction of some entire lineages
* Peralta 2016 : effect of phylogenies on species interaction and network structure ; also dependent on interction type
* Nuismer and Harmon (2015) EcoLet


Approches to study community evolution are usually phylogeny, traits and network evolution. Most of the time the focus is kept on how phylogeny influences traits and networks when the other directions can provide interesting knowledge.
* Traits and phylogeny are often mixed to study evolution (tree of traits evolution)


In this paper we want to investigate the influence of interaction type on communities evolution. We will take into account only positive and negative interactions, such as facilitation and competition respectively for instance. More specifically, we want to highlight the potential differences in the evolution of phylogenetic, traits and network structures that interaction types could induce. To do so, we will use a stochastic model based on speciation-extinction dynamic, which rebuild a community from one species and allowing the establishment of new species based on the number of there interactions. **Main result of the paper**
